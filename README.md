**This setup utilizes Terraform to automate the creation of a Docker container running Nginx. It pulls the latest Nginx image and runs it in a Docker container, exposing it on port 8000.

Prerequisites
Terraform: Ensure Terraform is installed. You can download it from terraform.io.
Docker: Docker must be installed and running on your machine. Installation instructions are available on docker.com.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

sh
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize the working directory and download the required provider plugins:

sh
Copy code
terraform init
Apply the Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the Docker resources:

Verify Deployment

After applying the configuration, the Nginx server should be running. You can access it by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Configuration Details
